A *blazingly fast* SkyBlock stats website using SvelteKit and Rust ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€

## Setup
1. Clone the repo

2. Follow the instructions in the `backend` and `frontend` folders to setup the development environment for each

3. Start up the server(s) that you won't be developing in with the following:

```bash
docker-compose up -d website # Working on backend
docker-compose up -d api # Working on frontend
```

For these to work properly, you will need to have the `.env` files in the `backend` and `frontend` folders filled out with the correct connection information.

Close the containers with `docker-compose down` when you are done.

4. Start up the server(s) you will be developing by following the instructions in the `backend` and `frontend` folders

## Deploying

1. Make a copy of both `.env.example` files in the subfolders and rename them to `.env.production`. Fill in the values with the internal hostnames of the containers and the correct information for your deployment.

2. Startup the containers with the correct override file as follows:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```
